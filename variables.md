# Working with Variables

I wrote this code to practice defining and performing functions on variables.

## How to Run

To run this code, go to Terminal or Command Prompt and run:

```
Python variables.py
```

## Content
First, I learned about types of variables, including integers, floats, strings, and finally introduced lists as variables. We did some basic arithematic operations using variables. It felt very much like doing algebra.
Then, I created a list variable, which was a set of numbers, and performed the following functions on it:

- 'print()'
- reverse()
- sort()
- append()
- count()
- index()
- len()

## Example 

Here I show how I used the append function in this program.

First, I defined the variable numbers, a list variable.

```
numbers = [34, 3, 5, 1, 49]
```

Then, I used the append function to add an element, 45, to numbers. Following that is the print function to display the addition of 45 to numbers.

```
numbers.append(45)

print(numbers)
```
45 is added at the end.

```
[34, 3, 5, 1, 49, 45]
```


That's it!
